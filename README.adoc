The above code uses some micro optimizations techniques. The endpoints exposed are as follows:

// this gets the key
POST /get: Body:- 

{ "key": "key_vale"}

//this inserts the key if it doesn't exists or else it updates it
POST /put: Body:- 

{
    "key": "key",
    "value": "value",
    "ttl": 100
}

//DELETES the key

POST /delete: Body:- 
{
  "key": "key_value"
 }
 
Created a periodic timer to delete expired keys in the CleanUpJob Verticle with a value of 6 hours.
